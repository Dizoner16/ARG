This project is made for fun! You can adjust password yourself! Dont forget to install all necessary libraries such as: openCV, numpy, mediapipe. Notice: since webserver works on your local computer you can use "127.0.0.1" as an IP adress, moreover to access the website from another device (which is connected to your local network) open cmd and type "ipconfig /all", after that search for local IP. To connect just use the IP address you found. For instance: http://localIP:6969. Notice that port is changeable as well (6969 is used by default by the server).
